# A2SAM: Flaws can be Applause

[NeurIPS 2024] Flaws can be Applause: Unleashing Potential of Segmenting Ambiguous Objects in SAM

## Introduction

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper "Flaws can be Applause: Unleashing Potential of Segmenting Ambiguous Objects in SAM" (NeurIPS 2024). A2SAM is a novel approach that leverages the inherent ambiguities in object segmentation to improve the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

## Features

- Enhanced segmentation for ambiguous and overlapping objects
- Improved handling of complex scenes with multiple similar objects
- Built upon Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- Easy integration with existing SAM-based pipelines

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/a2sam.git
cd a2sam
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
python train_lidc.py
python train_sim10k.py
```
